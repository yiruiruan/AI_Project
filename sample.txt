The COVID‑19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).[1] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[4][6] The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March.[7][8] As of 19 July 2020, more than 14.2 million cases of COVID‑19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 600,000 deaths; more than 7.98 million people have recovered.[5]

The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[b] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[c] sneezing, and talking.[9][10][12] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.[9][13] Transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.[14] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[9][10] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.[9][10]
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.[9][15][16] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[17] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[18][19] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.[9] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.[20]

Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, disinfecting surfaces, increasing ventilation and air filtration indoors,[21] and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.[9][22] Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.

The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,[23] including the largest global recession since the Great Depression[24] and global famines affecting 265 million people.[25] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,[26] widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,[27][28][29] and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.[30][31] Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 172 countries, affecting approximately 98.5 percent of the world's student population.[32] Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media.[33] There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[34]
